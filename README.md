# Mint Green Programming Language

Mint Green is a super simple programming language, great for beginners into programming. It is based off of C++, and is not a really serious programming language, but more of a simple facade to begin programming in.

The attached sample programs show how to use these commands to fully take advantage of Mint Green. Mint Green is generally a loose language, but here are a few rules/issues you must follow:

* Whenever using variables in expressions or if statements a variable must come first. 

* At the beginning of every Mint Green program you must declare the number of lines. 
You must include blank lines, the terminating “$” command, and the declaration “[8]” itself in the number of lines.

* There is a fixed array that hold 100 integer variables and 100 character variables. I have not found a way to create a (virtually) infinite number of variables.

* You can use “~” to display a string, or make a character variable equal to a character.

* Your Mint Green program must be on a blank text file, and when asked for the name of it, you may or may not have to type “.txt” at the end. Also the program must be in the same folder as the compiler. I recommend just editing the sample programs to create your own program.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy Mint Green Programming Language!
