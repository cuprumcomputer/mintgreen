# Mint Green Programming Language

Mint Green is a small and simplistic programming language. Its syntax is based off of C++ and JQuery. The attached sample program shows how to use all of the commands to fully take advantage of Mint Green. There is also a “command key” at the bottom of the compiler code to show all of the commands. Mint Green is generally a loose language, but here are a few guidelines/bugs:

* Whenever using variables in expressions or if statements a variable must come first. 

* At the beginning of every Mint Green program you must declare the number of lines. 
You must include blank lines, the terminating “$” command, and the declaration “[8]” itself in the number of lines.

* In your program you can have only 100 character variables and 100 integer variables. (Unless you want to add more to the two variable arrays)

* You can use “~” to display a string, or make a variable equal to a character.

* A variable’s name can be virtually as long as you want, but must be only made up of the alphabet and no other characters.

* Your Mint Green program must be in the same folder as the compiler, and you may have to enter “.txt” at the end depending on the type of file.

* If when you try to run the Mint Green Compiler, it paused and declares a segmentation fault, quit your C++ compiler and retry. If it continues to happen, please note it in the issues.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy Mint Green Programming Language!
