# Mint Green Programming Language

Mint Green is a super simple programming language, and a great way to begin programming. It is based off of C++, and is not a really serious programming language, but more of a simple framework to begin programming in. It is a great way to be introduced to programming and I wish I had it when I began programming.

The attached sample programs show how to use all of the commands to fully take advantage of Mint Green. There is also a “command key” at the bottom of the compiler code to show all of the commands. Mint Green is generally a loose language, but here are a few guidelines:

* Whenever using variables in expressions or if statements a variable must come first. 

* At the beginning of every Mint Green program you must declare the number of lines. 
You must include blank lines, the terminating “$” command, and the declaration “[8]” itself in the number of lines.

* At this point, in your program you can have only 100 character variables and 100 integer variables.

* You can use “~” to display a string, or make a variable equal to a character.

* A variable’s can be virtually as long as you want, but must be only made up of the alphabet and no other characters.

* Your Mint Green program must be on a text file, and when asked for the name of it, you may have to type “.txt” at the end, and for the sample program you must. Also the program must be in the same folder as the compiler. I recommend just editing the sample program I provided to create your own program.

Thank you and I hope you enjoy Mint Green Programming Language!
